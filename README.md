# GPT Large Language Model  

This project is an implementation of an LLM trained on the *Wizard of Oz* text, adopted from *Create a Large Language Model from Scratch with Python* â€“ FreeCodeCamp.  

## Features  
- Implements a transformer-based model for text generation  
- Trains a custom LLM from scratch using PyTorch and CUDA  
- Covers tokenization, model architecture, and training  

## Libraries  
This project uses the following Python libraries:  
- Transformer
- PyTorch  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- Jupyter Notebook
